# EDA Hotel Booking Analysis using Python

## Introduction
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to gain insights into booking cancellations and provide recommendations to improve the hotel's efficiency and revenue generation. The analysis focuses on City Hotel and Resort Hotel and explores various factors related to cancellations and their impact on the business.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from XYZ Hotel Group and contains information about hotel bookings, including customer demographics, booking details, and cancellation status. The dataset covers a period from 2015 to 2017.

## Files
- `hotel_booking_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `hotel_bookings.csv`: The dataset in CSV format.

## Research Questions
1. What are the key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations?
2. How can the hotel management reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue generation?
3. How can pricing and promotional decisions be optimized based on the analysis of booking data?

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant columns if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing various features and their relationship with booking cancellations, identifying trends, patterns, and potential factors influencing cancellations.
3. Statistical analysis: Conducting statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing, to validate assumptions and draw meaningful conclusions.
4. Visualization: Creating informative charts, graphs, and visual representations to present key findings effectively.
5. Recommendations: Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis to reduce cancellations and improve revenue generation.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.
3. Open the `hotel_booking_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
4. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and view the analysis results.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into hotel booking cancellations and suggest effective strategies to minimize cancellations and optimize revenue generation. The findings can assist hotel management in making informed decisions related to pricing, promotions, and overall business strategies.
